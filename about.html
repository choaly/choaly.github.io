            Hi! I'm Alyssa. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Computer Science.
            <br>
            <br>
            Previously, I've built web apps to automate equipment testing at Northrop Grumman, and built protein models and a database to streamline drug development at Bristol Myers Squibb.
            <br>
            <br>
            I love building tools that deliver high-quality experiences to empower users and enrich their lives. At heart, I'm driven by intentionality, understanding, and the desire to enhance our collective human experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other aspirations, hobbies, and side quests include dancing, reading (currently: Dune), and running (2024 goal: a half-marathon!).
            <br>
