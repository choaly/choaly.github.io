            Hi! I'm Alyssa. I graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Computer Science.
            <br>
            <br>
            Previously, I've completed internships at Northrop Grumman building web apps to automate equipment testing, and at Bristol Myers Squibb constructing protein models and a database to streamline drug development workflows.
            <br>
            <br>
            I love building tools that deliver high-quality experiences and empower users to enrich their lives.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other aspirations, hobbies, and side quests include dancing, running, and reading.
            <br>
            <br>
